# MyTasks
An online application that allow users to store and manage their tasks.

## Application 

### Usage
The application is already running in Heroku and are accepting users creation with basic authentication and the CRUD operations in Tasks.
Application available in: <https://my-tasks-front.herokuapp.com>

### Purpose
After spending some hours learning about how to make an application in React, i took the challenge to upgrade the code used in this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErjWNvP6mko&ab_channel=FelipeRocha%E2%80%A2dicasparadevs>. 
- My first idea was to create a Rest API with NodeJS in the BackEnd to store data in an DataBase the users of the application and their Tasks.
- The application will have a simple authentication flow with email and password.
- For future upgrades some features could be implemented.

### Technologies, libraries and tools
- React
- NodeJS
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize
- Heroku

## Contributions 
PR are welcome, for this you can clone this repository to your machine and work in some upgrade, (for example one of the following). Then request a PR so we could talk about your implementation.

### Future Features
- OAuth 2.0 with Google/Facebook.
- Users Settings to control name and change password.
- Users preferences for application colors.
- Reset password with Nodemailer.


### What you can see
- All the codes will be mostly commented and explained to anyone that want to know how to do an Rest API.
- The major focus and explanation in this repository will stand in the backend development.
