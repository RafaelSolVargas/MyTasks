# MyTasks
A React application to users create their own tasks

### What is the purpose of this
After spending some hours learning about how to make a application in React, i took the challenge to upgrade the code used in the video (link down below). 
- My first idea is to create a Rest API with NodeJS and Sequelize ORM to store in a Postgres DataBase the users of the application and their Tasks.
- The application will have a simple login and a OAuth2.0 login with Google API

### Technologies and libraries
- React
- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize
- OAuth 2.0

### What you can see
- All the codes will be mostly commented and explained to anyone that want to know how to do an Rest API 
- The major focus and explanation in this repository will stand in the backend development
