Application available in: <https://my-tasks-front.herokuapp.com>.

## Purpose
After spending some hours learning about how to make an application in React, i took the challenge to upgrade the code used in this video <https://www.youtube.com/watchv=ErjWNvP6mko&ab_channel=FelipeRocha%E2%80%A2dicasparadevs>. <br> <br>
My first idea was to create a Rest API with NodeJS in the BackEnd to store data in an DataBase the users of the application and their Tasks. <br>
The application will have a simple authentication flow with email and password. <br>
For future upgrades some features could be implemented. <br>
